# One-Sided Box Filter 
1) preserve edges
2) high computation performance
## Perform on nine cases and select the best one

## As a result, this filter preserves edges

From left to right: original, iteration=10, iteration=100 and iteration=1000
## This filter is the fastest among all edge-preserving methods.
